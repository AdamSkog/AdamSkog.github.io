## Showcased Projects

### [ScolioVision](https://github.com/AdamSkog/Scoliosis-Xray-Classification)

- Built a ResNet-50 model with transfer learning to classify scoliosis from X-rays, achieving 95% test accuracy.
- Developed a PyTorch pipeline with model validation and optimization to handle a limited dataset of 250 images.
- Deployed TensorBoard on AWS Fargate for scalable, serverless training monitoring and cloud management.
- Utilized Docker for containerization and AWS services (ECR, ECS, IAM, VPC) for CI/CD conventions.

### [King County House Price Predictor](https://github.com/AdamSkog/Housing-Price-Prediction-King-County)

- Built XGBoost model to predict house prices with 85% accuracy, deployed via Streamlit for real-time inference.
- Conducted feature engineering (missing data, encoding, scaling, predictor selection) to boost performance.
- Used Optuna for hyperparameter tuning, improving accuracy and reducing overfitting.

### [StrokeSense](https://github.com/AdamSkog/Stroke-Risk-Classifier)

- Developed a stroke prediction model using Python, achieving 82% accuracy with a logistic regression pipeline.
- Conducted EDA on a dataset of 5110 entries and addressed imbalanced classes via SMOTE.
- Engineered feature scaling, categorical encoding, and oversampling, improving model performance by 15%.
- Deployed an interactive Streamlit app for real-time predictions, reducing user input time by 30%.
